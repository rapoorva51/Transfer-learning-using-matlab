# Mobile Phone Brand Prediction using AlexNet and Transfer Learning

This project uses transfer learning and the AlexNet architecture to predict mobile phone brands from images in MATLAB. It's a great example of how pre-trained neural networks can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- MATLAB (version X.X or higher)
- Deep Learning Toolbox
- Image Processing Toolbox
- A dataset of mobile phone brand images for training and testing

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   `git clone https://github.com/rapoorva51/Transfer-learning-using-matlab.git`  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
    `cd Transfer-learning-using-matlab`  
3. Download and prepare your dataset:
    - Place your mobile phone brand images in a directory structure suitable for training and testing.  
    - Update the dataset paths in the MATLAB script as necessary.
4. Open and run the MATLAB script:
Open the majorprojectaiedgeon transferlearning-2.m script in MATLAB and follow the instructions provided in the comments. This script performs the following steps:  
    - Load and preprocess the dataset.  
    - Load the pre-trained AlexNet model.
	 - Fine-tune the model for mobile phone brand prediction.
    - Train the model.
    - Evaluate the model's performance.
    - Make predictions on new images.

## Usage
- Modify the script to adapt it to your specific dataset and requirements.  
- Experiment with different hyperparameters and data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
